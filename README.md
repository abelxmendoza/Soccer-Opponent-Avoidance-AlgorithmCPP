# Soccer Opponent Avoidance Algorithm

This is a C++ implementation of a soccer opponent avoidance algorithm. The algorithm utilizes two different approaches: exhaustive search and dynamic programming. The implementation consists of two files: `exhaustive3.cpp` and `dynamic3.cpp`.

## Requirements

To run the program, you will need a C++ compiler that supports C++11 standard. The recommended compiler is `clang++`.

## Usage

To run the exhaustive search algorithm, execute the following command:

```
clang++ -std=c++11 exhaustive3.cpp -o exhaustive3.out
```

```
./exhaustive3.out
```


To run the dynamic programming algorithm, execute the following command:

```
clang++ -std=c++11 dynamic3.cpp -o dynamic3.out
```

```
./dynamic3.out
```

## File structure

* `exhaustive3.cpp`: Contains the implementation of the exhaustive search algorithm.
* `dynamic3.cpp`: Contains the implementation of the dynamic programming algorithm.
